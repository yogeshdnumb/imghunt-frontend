1
00:04:16,900 --> 00:04:18,109
Whoa, there!

2
00:04:36,128 --> 00:04:37,278
Halt!

3
00:04:38,881 --> 00:04:40,131
Who goes there?

4
00:04:40,382 --> 00:04:44,552
It is I, Arthur, Son of Uther Pendragon,
from the castle of Camelot.

5
00:04:44,970 --> 00:04:47,805
King of the Britons,
defeater of the Saxons.

6
00:04:48,473 --> 00:04:50,641
Sovereign of all England!

7
00:04:52,102 --> 00:04:53,553
Pull the other one.

8
00:04:53,653 --> 00:04:56,939
I am, and this is my trusty servant, Patsy.

9
00:04:57,316 --> 00:05:00,810
We have ridden the length and
breadth of the land in search of knights

10
00:05:00,910 --> 00:05:05,823
who will join me in my court at Camelot.
I must speak with your lord and master.

11
00:05:06,575 --> 00:05:08,784
- What? Ridden on a horse?
- Yes.

12
00:05:08,994 --> 00:05:11,154
- You're using coconuts!
- What?

13
00:05:11,254 --> 00:05:15,158
You've got two empty halves of coconut,
and you're banging them together.

14
00:05:15,258 --> 00:05:19,170
So? We have ridden since
the snows of winter covered this land.

15
00:05:19,671 --> 00:05:23,249
- Through the Kingdom of Mercia. Thru...
- Where'd you get the coconuts?

16
00:05:23,349 --> 00:05:24,542
We found them.

17
00:05:24,642 --> 00:05:27,845
Found them? In Mercia?
The coconut is tropical.

18
00:05:28,305 --> 00:05:31,007
- What do you mean?
- Well, this is a temperate zone.

19
00:05:31,107 --> 00:05:34,761
The swallow may fly south with the
sun or the house martin or the plumber

20
00:05:34,861 --> 00:05:39,190
may seek warmer climes in winter,
yet these are not strangers to our land.

21
00:05:40,192 --> 00:05:45,104
- Are you suggesting coconuts migrate?
- Not at all. They could be carried.

22
00:05:45,204 --> 00:05:49,909
- What? A swallow carrying a coconut?
- It could grip it by the husk.

23
00:05:50,369 --> 00:05:55,206
It's not a question of where he grips it.
It's a simple question of weight ratio.

24
00:05:55,707 --> 00:05:59,869
A five-ounce bird could not carry
a one-pound coconut.

25
00:05:59,969 --> 00:06:01,122
Well, it doesn't matter.

26
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:04,655
Will you go and tell your master that
Arthur from the Court of Camelot is here.

27
00:06:06,385 --> 00:06:09,512
Listen, in order to
maintain air-speed velocity,

28
00:06:09,721 --> 00:06:14,392
a swallow needs to beat its
wings 43 times every second, right?

29
00:06:14,518 --> 00:06:16,394
- Please!
- Am I right?

30
00:06:17,229 --> 00:06:18,482
I'm not interested.

31
00:06:18,710 --> 00:06:21,330
It could be carried by an African swallow.

32
00:06:22,150 --> 00:06:26,813
Oh, yeah, an African swallow maybe, but
not a European swallow. That's my point.

33
00:06:26,913 --> 00:06:28,147
Oh, yeah, I agree with that.

34
00:06:28,247 --> 00:06:32,576
Will you ask your master
if he wants to join my court at Camelot?!

35
00:06:33,537 --> 00:06:36,614
But then of course, uh, African
swallows are non-migratory.

36
00:06:36,714 --> 00:06:37,714
Oh, yeah.

37
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:39,800
So, they couldn't bring
a coconut back anyway.

38
00:06:40,585 --> 00:06:44,171
Wait a minute! Supposing two swallows
carried it together?

39
00:06:44,589 --> 00:06:46,589
No, they'd have to have it on a line.

40
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:49,100
Well, simple! They'd just
use a strand of creeper!

41
00:06:49,845 --> 00:06:52,245
What, held under the
dorsal guiding feathers?

42
00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:53,400
Well, why not?

43
00:06:55,225 --> 00:06:56,767
Bring out your dead!

44
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,500
Bring out your dead!

45
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,500
Bring out your dead!

46
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:11,700
Bring out your dead!

47
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:15,800
Bring out your dead!

48
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,500
Bring out your dead!

49
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,500
Bring out your dead!

50
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,500
Bring out your dead!

51
00:07:28,633 --> 00:07:29,783
Ninepence.

52
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,500
Bring out your dead!

53
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:39,300
Bring out your dead!

54
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,500
Bring out your dead!

55
00:07:49,571 --> 00:07:51,739
- Bring out your dead.
- Here's one.

56
00:07:51,990 --> 00:07:53,140
Ninepence.

57
00:07:53,166 --> 00:07:54,734
- I'm not dead!
- What?

58
00:07:54,834 --> 00:07:57,487
- Nothing. Here's your ninepence.
- I'm not dead!

59
00:07:57,587 --> 00:07:59,822
- 'Ere. He says he's not dead!
- Yes, he is.

60
00:07:59,850 --> 00:08:01,335
- I'm not!
- He isn't?

61
00:08:01,380 --> 00:08:03,950
- Well, he will be soon. He's very ill.
- I'm getting better!

62
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:05,940
No, you're not. You'll be
stone dead in a moment.

63
00:08:06,012 --> 00:08:08,664
Oh, I can't take him like
that. It's against regulations.

64
00:08:08,764 --> 00:08:12,085
- I don't want to go on the cart.
- Oh, don't be such a baby.

65
00:08:12,185 --> 00:08:14,337
- I can't take him.
- I feel fine.

66
00:08:14,437 --> 00:08:16,464
- Well, do us a favor.
- I can't.

67
00:08:16,564 --> 00:08:19,175
Well, can you hang around a
couple of minutes? He won't be long.

68
00:08:19,275 --> 00:08:21,969
No, I've got to go to the
Robinsons'. They've lost nine today.

69
00:08:22,069 --> 00:08:23,846
- Well, when's your next round?
- Thursday.

70
00:08:23,946 --> 00:08:26,946
- I think I'll go for a walk.
- You're not fooling anyone, you know.

71
00:08:26,999 --> 00:08:32,999
- Look. Isn't there something you can do?
- I feel happy. I feel happy.

72
00:08:34,116 --> 00:08:37,068
- Ah, thanks very much.
- Not at all. See you on Thursday.

73
00:08:37,168 --> 00:08:38,318
Right. All right.

74
00:08:42,207 --> 00:08:45,126
- Who's that, then?
- I don't know. Must be a king.

75
00:08:45,418 --> 00:08:48,003
- Why?
- He hasn't got shit all over him.

76
00:09:11,903 --> 00:09:13,529
- Old woman!
- Man!

77
00:09:13,989 --> 00:09:17,408
Man. Sorry. What knight
lives in that castle over there?

78
00:09:17,534 --> 00:09:19,785
- I'm 37.
- I-- what?

79
00:09:20,078 --> 00:09:21,678
I'm 37. I'm not old.

80
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:25,200
- Well, I can't just call you 'Man'.
- Well, you could say 'Dennis'.

81
00:09:25,300 --> 00:09:27,080
Well, I didn't know you
were called 'Dennis'.

82
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:28,980
Well, you didn't bother
to find out, did you?

83
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,920
I did say 'sorry' about the 'old
woman', but from the behind you looked...

84
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,000
What I object to is that you
automatically treat me like an inferior!

85
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,877
- Well, I am king.
- Oh, King, eh, very nice.

86
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,835
And how d'you get that, eh?
By exploiting the workers!

87
00:09:41,460 --> 00:09:44,872
By hanging on to outdated
imperialist dogma which perpetuates

88
00:09:45,278 --> 00:09:48,264
the economic and social
differences in our society!

89
00:09:48,364 --> 00:09:50,464
If there's ever going
to be any progress...

90
00:09:50,470 --> 00:09:52,470
Dennis, there's some
lovely filth down here.

91
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:54,500
Oh! How d'you do?

92
00:09:55,204 --> 00:09:58,191
How do you do, good lady?
I am Arthur, King of the Britons.

93
00:09:58,291 --> 00:10:00,693
- Who's castle is that?
- King of the who?

94
00:10:00,793 --> 00:10:02,953
- The Britons.
- Who are the Britons?

95
00:10:03,205 --> 00:10:06,207
Well, we all are. We are all
Britons, and I am your king.

96
00:10:06,958 --> 00:10:10,119
Didn't know we had a king. I thought
we were an autonomous collective.

97
00:10:10,219 --> 00:10:13,039
You're fooling yourself.
We're living in a dictatorship.

98
00:10:13,139 --> 00:10:16,209
A self-perpetuating autocracy
in which the working classes...

99
00:10:16,309 --> 00:10:18,309
Oh, there you go
bringing class into it again.

100
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:21,000
That's what it's all about. If
only people would hear of...

101
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Please, good people. I am in haste.

102
00:10:23,934 --> 00:10:25,684
Who lives in that castle?

103
00:10:26,311 --> 00:10:28,346
- No one lives there.
- Then who is your lord?

104
00:10:28,446 --> 00:10:30,246
- We don't have a lord.
- What?

105
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:33,300
I told you. We're an
anarcho-syndicalist commune.

106
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:37,000
We take it in turns to act as a
sort of executive officer for the week...

107
00:10:37,050 --> 00:10:38,050
Yes.

108
00:10:38,060 --> 00:10:39,960
...but all the decisions
of that officer have...

109
00:10:39,970 --> 00:10:41,970
...to be ratified at a special
bi-weekly meeting...

110
00:10:41,980 --> 00:10:42,980
Yes, I see.

111
00:10:42,990 --> 00:10:45,570
...by a simple majority in the
case of purely internal affairs...

112
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:46,600
Be quiet!

113
00:10:46,610 --> 00:10:48,960
..but by a two-thirds majority
in the case of more major...

114
00:10:48,980 --> 00:10:51,119
Be quiet! I order
you to be quiet.

115
00:10:51,336 --> 00:10:53,412
Order, eh? Who does he think he is? Heh.

116
00:10:53,512 --> 00:10:56,131
- I am your king!
- Well, I didn't vote for you.

117
00:10:56,466 --> 00:10:59,677
- You don't vote for kings.
- Well, how did you become King, then?

118
00:11:00,345 --> 00:11:05,057
The Lady of the Lake, her arm clad
in the purest shimmering samite,

119
00:11:05,308 --> 00:11:08,435
held aloft Excalibur
from the bosom of the water,

120
00:11:09,020 --> 00:11:13,941
signifying, by divine providence,
that I, Arthur, was to carry Excalibur.

121
00:11:14,442 --> 00:11:15,935
That is why I'm your king!

122
00:11:16,035 --> 00:11:20,531
Listen. Strange women lying in ponds,
distributing swords, is no basis

123
00:11:20,657 --> 00:11:23,943
for a system of government.
Supreme executive power

124
00:11:24,043 --> 00:11:28,614
derives from a mandate from the masses.
Not from some farcical aquatic ceremony.

125
00:11:28,714 --> 00:11:29,782
Be quiet!

126
00:11:29,882 --> 00:11:32,255
Well, but you can't expect
to wield supreme executive

127
00:11:32,279 --> 00:11:34,882
power just 'cause some
watery tart threw a sword at you!

128
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:36,500
Shut up!

129
00:11:36,556 --> 00:11:38,983
I mean, if I went 'round
saying I was an emperor just

130
00:11:39,058 --> 00:11:43,337
because some moistened bint had lobbed
a scimitar at me, they'd put me away!

131
00:11:43,437 --> 00:11:44,782
Shut up, will you? Shut up!

132
00:11:44,806 --> 00:11:47,406
Ah, now we see the
violence inherent in the system.

133
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:48,500
Shut up!

134
00:11:48,635 --> 00:11:51,312
Oh! Come and see the
violence inherent in the system!

135
00:11:51,479 --> 00:11:54,473
- Help! Help! I'm being repressed!
- Bloody peasant!

136
00:11:54,573 --> 00:11:57,076
Oh, what a give-away. Did you
hear that? Did you hear that, eh?

137
00:11:57,076 --> 00:11:58,576
That's what I'm on
about. Did you see

138
00:11:58,610 --> 00:12:00,273
him repressing me?
You saw it, didn't you?

139
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:40,003
You fight with the strength of many men,
Sir Knight.

140
00:13:43,174 --> 00:13:45,342
I am Arthur, King of the Britons.

141
00:13:49,681 --> 00:13:51,921
I seek the finest and
the bravest knights in

142
00:13:51,945 --> 00:13:54,184
the land to join me in
my court at Camelot.

143
00:13:59,649 --> 00:14:02,985
You have proved yourself worthy.
Will you join me?

144
00:14:08,616 --> 00:14:11,702
You make me sad. So be it. Come, Patsy.

145
00:14:12,036 --> 00:14:13,704
None shall pass.

146
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:16,165
- What?
- None shall pass.

147
00:14:16,833 --> 00:14:20,578
I have no quarrel with you, good
Sir Knight, but I must cross this bridge.

148
00:14:20,678 --> 00:14:22,880
Then you shall die.

149
00:14:23,756 --> 00:14:27,718
I command you, as King of the Britons,
to stand aside.

150
00:14:28,011 --> 00:14:31,597
I move for no man.

151
00:14:33,391 --> 00:14:34,600
So be it!

152
00:15:01,336 --> 00:15:03,412
Now, stand aside, worthy adversary.

153
00:15:03,512 --> 00:15:06,715
- 'Tis but a scratch.
- "A scratch"? Your arm's off!

154
00:15:06,841 --> 00:15:09,218
- No, it isn't.
- Well, what's that, then?

155
00:15:10,303 --> 00:15:11,754
- I've had worse.
- You liar!

156
00:15:11,854 --> 00:15:13,472
Come on, ya pansy!

157
00:15:21,523 --> 00:15:22,898
Victory is mine!

158
00:15:24,734 --> 00:15:26,902
We thank Thee Lord, that in Thy mer...

159
00:15:28,196 --> 00:15:29,780
- Come on, then.
- What?

160
00:15:30,114 --> 00:15:31,323
Have at you!

161
00:15:33,034 --> 00:15:35,486
Eh. You are indeed brave,
Sir Knight, but the fight is mine.

162
00:15:35,586 --> 00:15:37,162
Oh, had enough, eh?

163
00:15:38,122 --> 00:15:40,741
Look, you stupid bastard.
You've got no arms left.

164
00:15:40,841 --> 00:15:42,292
- Yes, I have.
- Look!

165
00:15:42,710 --> 00:15:44,211

<i>who had nearly fought
the Dragon of Angnor,</i>

256

<i>who had nearly stood up to
the vicious Chicken of Bristol,</i>

<i>and who had personally wet himself
at the Battle of Badon Hill.</i>

258

Sir Not-appearing-in-this-film.</i>

It is King Arthur, and these are

Whose castle is this?

308
00:26:23,851 --> 00:26:27,145
This is the castle of my master,
Guy de Loimbard.

309
00:26:27,438 --> 00:26:31,316
Go and tell your master
that we have been charged by God

310
00:26:31,775 --> 00:26:36,237
with a sacred quest. If he will give us
food and shelter for the night,

311
00:26:36,614 --> 00:26:39,490
he can join us in our quest
for the Holy Grail.

312
00:26:39,825 --> 00:26:42,994
Well, I'll ask him,
but I don't think he'll be very keen.

313
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:45,163
Uh, he's already got one, you see.

314
00:26:46,332 --> 00:26:48,791
- What?
- He says they've already got one!

315
00:26:50,252 --> 00:26:53,963
- Are you sure he's got one?
- Oh, yes. It's very nice-a.

316
00:26:54,840 --> 00:26:57,008
I told him we've already got one.

317
00:27:00,179 --> 00:27:02,364
Well, u... um, can we
come up and have a look?

318
00:27:02,388 --> 00:27:04,474
Of course not! You are English types-a!

319
00:27:06,143 --> 00:27:08,386
- Well, what are you then?
- I'm French.

320
00:27:08,486 --> 00:27:12,482
I'm French! Why do think I have this
outrageous accent, you silly king-a?!

321
00:27:12,983 --> 00:27:16,152
- What are you doing in England?
- Mind your own business!

322
00:27:17,821 --> 00:27:21,566
If you will not show us the Grail,
we shall take your castle by force!

323

You don't frighten us, English pig-dogs!

324
00:27:25,454 --> 00:27:29,374

so-called Arthur King,

326
00:27:33,796 --> 00:27:38,596
you and all your silly
English k-nnnnniggets.

327
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:43,000
Thpppppt! Thppt! Thppt!

328
00:27:44,723 --> 00:27:48,093
- What a strange person.
- Now look here, my good man...

329
00:27:48,193 --> 00:27:50,561
I don't wanna talk to you no more,

330
00:27:50,854 --> 00:27:54,148
you empty headed animal food trough wiper!

331
00:27:54,525 --> 00:27:57,277
I fart in your general direction.

332
00:27:57,778 --> 00:28:02,699
Your mother was a hamster,
and your father smelt of elderberries!

333
00:28:04,910 --> 00:28:07,612
Is there someone else up there
we could talk to?

334
00:28:07,712 --> 00:28:11,582
No. Now, go away, or I shall
taunt you a second time-a!

335
00:28:13,961 --> 00:28:17,630
Now, this is your last chance.
I've been more than reasonable...

336
00:28:17,756 --> 00:28:19,165
- Fetchez la vache!
- Quoi?

337
00:28:19,265 --> 00:28:20,717
Fetchez la vache!

338
00:28:23,095 --> 00:28:26,222
If you do not agree to my commands,
then I shall...

00:28:30,811 --> 00:28:31,961

00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:36,740
Right! Charge!

342
00:28:36,757 --> 00:28:38,757
KNIGHTS: Charge!

343
00:28:44,300 --> 00:28:46,300
Hey, this one is for your
mother! There you go.

344
00:28:50,500 --> 00:28:53,958

346
00:29:04,511 --> 00:29:06,804
- Fiends! I'll tear them apart!
- No, no. No, no.

347
00:29:06,930 --> 00:29:09,849
Sir! I have a plan, sir.

348
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:39,000
- C'est un lapin, lapin de bois.
- Quoi?

349
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:46,388
- Un cadeau.
- What?

350
00:30:46,412 --> 00:30:47,412
A present.

351
00:30:47,500 --> 00:30:49,084
- Oh, un cadeau.
- Oui, oui. Allons-y.

352
00:30:49,100 --> 00:30:50,199
- What?
- Let's go.

353
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:53,000
Oh.

354
00:30:57,500 --> 00:31:02,500
FRENCH GUARDS: On y
va. Bon magne. Over here...

355
00:31:14,141 --> 00:31:15,300
What happens now?

356
00:31:15,400 --> 00:31:20,313
Well, now, uh, Lancelot, Galahad,
and I, uh, wait until nightfall,

357
00:31:20,731 --> 00:31:24,901
and then leap out of the rabbit,
taking the French, uh, by surprise.

358
00:31:25,402 --> 00:31:28,070
Not only by surprise, but totally unarmed!

359
00:31:29,072 --> 00:31:30,281
Who leaps out?

360
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:33,534
U-- u-- uh, Lancelot, Galahad, and I,

361
00:31:34,786 --> 00:31:37,586
uh, leap out of the rabbit, uh, and uh...

362
00:31:37,610 --> 00:31:39,610
Ohh.

363
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:46,000
Oh. Um, l... look, i... i... if we
built this large wooden badger...

364
00:31:49,593 --> 00:31:50,669
Run away!

365
00:31:50,670 --> 00:31:56,670
KNIGHTS: Run away! Run away! Run away!
Run away! Run away! Run away! Run away!

366
00:32:01,772 --> 00:32:04,315
<i>- History for Schools. Take 8.
- Action!</i>

367
00:32:04,775 --> 00:32:08,611
Defeat at the castle seems to have
utterly disheartened King Arthur.

368
00:32:08,946 --> 00:32:13,733
The ferocity of the French taunting
took him completely by surprise.

369
00:32:13,833 --> 00:32:18,120
And Arthur became convinced
that a new strategy was required

370
00:32:18,288 --> 00:32:22,667
if the quest for the Holy Grail were
to be brought to a successful conclusion.

371
00:32:22,793 --> 00:32:25,628
Arthur, having consulted
his closest knights

372
00:32:26,004 --> 00:32:30,299
decided that they should separate,
and search for the Grail individually.

373
00:32:30,676 --> 00:32:32,510
Now, this is what they did...

374
00:32:35,806 --> 00:32:36,956
Frank!

375
00:32:48,527 --> 00:32:51,404
<i>So, each of the knights
went their separate ways.</i>

376
00:32:51,697 --> 00:32:54,991

Welcome, gentle Sir Knight.
Welcome to the Castle Anthrax.

But we are nice, and we will attend

very dull and quiet compared to yours.

480
00:38:54,601 --> 00:38:57,144

- They're doctors?!

485

Uh, they... have a basic
medical training, yes.

486
00:39:19,850 --> 00:39:20,850
B... but...

487
00:39:20,860 --> 00:39:23,528
Oh, come. Come. You must try to rest.

Practise your art.

489
00:39:34,391 --> 00:39:37,226
- Try to relax.
- Are you sure that's absolutely necessary?

490
00:39:37,686 --> 00:39:39,186
We must examine you.

491
00:39:42,148 --> 00:39:45,526
- There's nothing wrong with that!
- Please. We are doctors.

492
00:39:47,946 --> 00:39:49,530
Look! This cannot be.

493
00:39:50,073 --> 00:39:52,358
- I am sworn to chastity!
- Back to your bed! At once!

494
00:39:52,458 --> 00:39:55,244
Torment me no longer.
I have seen the Grail!

495
00:39:55,578 --> 00:39:58,414
- There's no Grail here.
- I have seen it! I have seen it!

496
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:01,542
- I have seen...
GIRLS: Hello.

497
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:03,000
Oh.

498
00:40:06,840 --> 00:40:12,840
GIRLS: Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello.
Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello.

499
00:40:12,900 --> 00:40:16,311
GIRLS: Hello. Hello.
Hello. Hello. Hello.

500
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:20,599
GIRLS: Hello. Hello. Hello.
Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello.

501
00:40:27,861 --> 00:40:28,861
Zoot!

502
00:40:28,870 --> 00:40:31,672
No, I am Zoot's
identical twin sister, Dingo.

503
00:40:31,696 --> 00:40:32,967
Oh, well, excuse me, I...

504
00:40:32,991 --> 00:40:35,534
- Where are you going?
- I seek the Grail!

505
00:40:35,660 --> 00:40:37,870
I have seen it, here in this castle!

506
00:40:38,955 --> 00:40:43,333
Oh, no. Oh, no! Bad, bad Zoot!

507
00:40:43,668 --> 00:40:47,004
- Well, what is it?
- Oh, wicked, bad, naughty Zoot!

508
00:40:47,505 --> 00:40:49,433
She has been setting
alight to our beacon,

509
00:40:49,457 --> 00:40:51,717
which, I have just
remembered, is grail-shaped.

510
00:40:52,135 --> 00:40:54,462
It's not the first time
we've had this problem.

511
00:40:54,562 --> 00:40:56,263
It's not the real Grail?

512
00:40:56,556 --> 00:40:59,475
Oh, wicked, bad, naughty, evil Zoot!

513
00:40:59,601 --> 00:41:02,936
Oh, she is a bad person,
and must pay the penalty!

514
00:41:04,647 --> 00:41:06,891
Do you think this scene
should have been cut?

515
00:41:06,991 --> 00:41:10,991
We were so worried when the boys
were writing it, but now, we're glad.

516
00:41:10,999 --> 00:41:13,227
It's better than some
previous scenes, I think.

517
00:41:13,656 --> 00:41:15,049
At least ours was better visually.

518
00:41:15,100 --> 00:41:18,040
Well, at least ours was committed.
It wasn't just a string of pussy jokes.

519
00:41:18,085 --> 00:41:20,613
- Get on with it.
- Yes. Get on with it!

520
00:41:20,713 --> 00:41:23,332
<i>ARMY OF KNIGHTS: Get on with it!</i>

521
00:41:23,917 --> 00:41:27,669
- Oh, I am enjoying this scene.
<i>- Get on with it!</i>

522
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:33,000
Oh, wicked, wicked Zoot.

523
00:41:35,720 --> 00:41:37,471
She must pay the penalty,

524
00:41:37,680 --> 00:41:39,766
and here in Castle
Anthrax, we have but one

525
00:41:39,790 --> 00:41:42,476
punishment for setting
alight the grail-shaped beacon

526
00:41:43,103 --> 00:41:46,021
You must tie her down on a bed,
and spank her.

527
00:41:46,231 --> 00:41:48,357
GIRLS: A spanking! A spanking!

528
00:41:48,360 --> 00:41:50,760
You must spank her well,
and after you have spanked her,

529
00:41:50,770 --> 00:41:54,270
you may deal with her as
you like, and then, spank me.

530
00:41:54,300 --> 00:41:56,300
- And, then, spank me.
GIRLS: And me! And me!

531
00:41:56,350 --> 00:41:58,836
Yes. Yes, you must give
us all a good spanking!

532
00:41:58,850 --> 00:42:01,685
GIRLS: A spanking! A spanking!
There is going to be a spanking tonight!

533
00:42:02,455 --> 00:42:05,413
And, after the
spanking, the oral sex.

534
00:42:05,437 --> 00:42:08,255
GIRLS:
The oral sex! The oral sex!

535
00:42:08,336 --> 00:42:10,020
Well, I could stay a bit longer.

536
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:12,200
- Sir Galahad!
- Oh, hello.

537
00:42:12,600 --> 00:42:14,602
- Quick! Quick!
- What? Why?

538
00:42:14,650 --> 00:42:15,650
You are in great peril!

539
00:42:15,700 --> 00:42:17,719
- No, he isn't!
- Silence, foul temptress!

540
00:42:17,800 --> 00:42:20,500
- You know, she's got a point.
- Come on! We will cover your escape!

541
00:42:20,550 --> 00:42:21,686
- Look, I'm fine!
- Come on!

542
00:42:21,700 --> 00:42:22,700
Wait, Sir Galahad!

543
00:42:22,900 --> 00:42:24,929
No. Look, I can tackle
this lot single-handed!

544
00:42:24,953 --> 00:42:26,846
Yes! Let him tackle
us single-handed!

545
00:42:26,870 --> 00:42:28,350
Yes! Let him tackle us single-handed!

546
00:42:28,360 --> 00:42:29,360
No, Sir Galahad. Come!

547
00:42:29,500 --> 00:42:32,000
No! Really! Honestly, I can
cope. I can handle this lot easily.

548
00:42:32,100 --> 00:42:33,483
Oh, yes. Let him handle us easily.

549
00:42:33,490 --> 00:42:35,594
- Yes. Let him handle us easily.
- No. Quick! Quick!

550
00:42:35,600 --> 00:42:38,653
Wait! Please! I can defeat them!
There's only 150 of them!

551
00:42:38,658 --> 00:42:41,251
Yes! Yes, he will beat us
easily! We haven't a chance.

552
00:42:41,275 --> 00:42:45,275
We haven't a chance.
He will beat us easily...

553
00:42:45,582 --> 00:42:46,832
Oh, shit!

554
00:42:47,250 --> 00:42:49,338
We were in the nick of
time. You were in great peril.

555
00:42:49,340 --> 00:42:50,340
I don't think I was.

556
00:42:50,350 --> 00:42:52,050
Yes, you were. You were in terrible peril.

557
00:42:52,060 --> 00:42:53,980
Look, let me go back
in there and face the peril.

558
00:42:53,990 --> 00:42:54,990
No, it's too perilous.

559
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:57,550
Look, it's my duty as a knight
to sample as much peril as I can.

560
00:42:57,560 --> 00:42:59,395
No, we've got to find
the Holy Grail. Come on!

561
00:42:59,400 --> 00:43:01,130
Oh, let me have
just a little bit of peril?

562
00:43:01,140 --> 00:43:02,140
No. It's unhealthy.

563
00:43:02,200 --> 00:43:04,035
- I bet you're gay.
- No, I'm not.

564
00:43:05,602 --> 00:43:09,313
<i>Sir Lancelot had saved Sir Galahad
from almost certain temptation.</i>

565
00:43:09,606 --> 00:43:12,149
<i>But, they were still no nearer the Grail.</i>

566
00:43:12,442 --> 00:43:16,103
<i>Meanwhile, King Arthur and Sir Bedevere,
not more than a swallow's flight away,</i>

567
00:43:16,203 --> 00:43:18,113
<i>had discovered something.</i>

568
00:43:19,157 --> 00:43:21,492
<i>Oh, that's an unladen
swallow's flight, obviously.</i>

569
00:43:21,500 --> 00:43:24,050
<i> I mean, they were more than
two laden swallow's flights away...</i>

570
00:43:24,060 --> 00:43:26,496
<i>...four, really, if they had a
coconut on a line between them</i>

571
00:43:26,672 --> 00:43:28,282
<i> I mean, if the birds were walking...</i>

572
00:43:28,382 --> 00:43:30,284
Get on with it!

573
00:43:30,384 --> 00:43:31,384
<i>Oh, anyway,</i>

574
00:43:31,476 --> 00:43:34,955
<i>on to Scene 24, which is a smashing
scene, with some lovely acting,</i>

575
00:43:35,055 --> 00:43:37,208
<i>in which Arthur discovers a vital clue</i>

576
00:43:37,308 --> 00:43:38,830
<i>and in which there
aren't any swallows,</i>

577
00:43:38,854 --> 00:43:40,819
<i>although I think you can
hear a starling-- oooh!</i>

578
00:43:42,138 --> 00:43:45,974
And this enchanter of whom you speak,
he has seen the Grail?

579
00:43:51,189 --> 00:43:52,689
Where does he live?

580
00:43:52,899 --> 00:43:54,483
Old man, where does he live?

581
00:43:55,818 --> 00:44:00,697
He knows of a cave.
A cave which no man has entered.

582
00:44:01,157 --> 00:44:04,701
- And the Grail. The Grail is there?
- There is much danger.

583
00:44:05,328 --> 00:44:09,414
For beyond the cave
lies the Gorge of Eternal Peril,

584
00:44:09,958 --> 00:44:12,376
which no man has ever crossed.

585
00:44:12,835 --> 00:44:15,254
But the Grail. Where is the Grail?

586
00:44:15,922 --> 00:44:19,049
Seek you the Bridge of Death.

587
00:44:20,635 --> 00:44:23,345
The Bridge of Death?
Which leads to the Grail?

588
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:08,800
- Ni!
- Ni! Ni! Ni! Ni! Ni!

589
00:45:08,850 --> 00:45:13,637
- Who are you?
- We are the Knights Who Say... 'Ni'!

590
00:45:13,737 --> 00:45:16,265
- No! Not the Knights Who Say 'Ni'!
- The same!

591
00:45:16,365 --> 00:45:20,110
- Who are they?
- We are the keepers of the sacred words.

592
00:45:20,653 --> 00:45:23,989
"Ni," "Peng," and "Neee Wom"!

593
00:45:24,824 --> 00:45:27,318
Those who hear them
seldom live to tell the tale.

594
00:45:27,418 --> 00:45:31,780
The knights who say "Ni"
demand a sacrifice.

595
00:45:31,880 --> 00:45:34,208
Knights of Ni, we are but simple travelers

596
00:45:34,300 --> 00:45:36,394
who seek the enchanter
who lives beyond these woods.

597
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:37,760
- Ni! Ni!
- Ni! Ni! Ni! Ni! Ni!...

598
00:45:44,427 --> 00:45:48,972
We shall say "Ni" again to you,
if you do not appease us.

599
00:45:49,599 --> 00:45:51,933
- Well, what is it you want?
- We want...

600
00:45:53,895 --> 00:45:55,645
... a shrubbery.

601
00:45:56,522 --> 00:45:57,556
A what?

602
00:45:57,656 --> 00:46:01,769
- Ni! Ni! Ni! Ni!
- Please! Please! No more!

603
00:46:01,869 --> 00:46:05,606
- We will find you a shrubbery.
- You must return here with a shrubbery,

604
00:46:05,706 --> 00:46:09,076
or else, you will never pass
through this wood...

605
00:46:09,577 --> 00:46:10,994
...alive.

606
00:46:11,287 --> 00:46:13,697
O Knights of Ni, you are just and fair,

607
00:46:13,797 --> 00:46:16,658
- and we will return with a shrubbery.
- One that looks nice.

608
00:46:16,758 --> 00:46:18,702
- Of course.
- And not too expensive.

609
00:46:18,802 --> 00:46:22,089
- Yes.
- Now... go!

610
00:47:05,925 --> 00:47:08,218
Stop that! Stop that! Stop that!

611
00:47:08,386 --> 00:47:13,886
Look on! Clear off! Go on!
Go away! Go away! Go away!

612
00:47:14,392 --> 00:47:15,551
And you, clear off!

613
00:47:21,315 --> 00:47:22,465
Hah. Bloody weather.

614
00:47:22,942 --> 00:47:24,860
The Tale of Sir Lancelot.

615
00:47:31,617 --> 00:47:34,536
One day, lad, all this will be yours.

616
00:47:34,662 --> 00:47:37,156
- What, the curtains?
- No. Not the curtains, lad.

617
00:47:37,256 --> 00:47:41,702
All that you can see, stretched out
over the hills and valleys of this land!

618
00:47:41,802 --> 00:47:43,620
That'll be your kingdom, lad.

619
00:47:43,720 --> 00:47:45,464
- But, Mother...
- Father, lad. Father.

620
00:47:45,631 --> 00:47:49,259
- But, Father, I don't want any of that.
- Listen, lad.

621
00:47:49,385 --> 00:47:54,264
I built this kingdom up from nothing. When
I started here, all there was was swamp.

622
00:47:54,765 --> 00:47:57,801
Other kings said I was daft
to build a castle on the swamp,

623
00:47:57,901 --> 00:48:01,021
but I built it all the
same, just to show 'em.

624
00:48:01,522 --> 00:48:03,307
It sank into the swamp. So...

625
00:48:03,407 --> 00:48:06,226
... I built a second one.
That sank into the swamp.

626
00:48:06,326 --> 00:48:10,147
So, I built a third one. That burned down,
fell over, then sank into the swamp.

627
00:48:10,247 --> 00:48:12,240
But the fourth one stayed up!

628
00:48:13,075 --> 00:48:15,152
And that's what you're gonna get, lad.

629
00:48:15,252 --> 00:48:19,998
- The strongest castle in these islands.
- But I don't want any of that.

630
00:48:20,583 --> 00:48:22,375
- I'd rather...
- Rather what?!

631
00:48:22,585 --> 00:48:24,586
I'd rather... just...

632
00:48:25,713 --> 00:48:28,582
- sing!
- Stop that! Stop that!

633
00:48:28,682 --> 00:48:31,426
You're not going into a song
while I'm here. Now listen, lad.

634
00:48:31,552 --> 00:48:33,837
In twenty minutes, you're
getting married to a girl

635
00:48:33,937 --> 00:48:37,933
whose father owns the biggest
tracts of open land in Britain.

636
00:48:38,100 --> 00:48:40,844
- But I don't want land.
- Listen, Alice.

637
00:48:40,944 --> 00:48:42,513
- Herbert.
- 'Erbert.

638
00:48:42,613 --> 00:48:46,024
We live in a bloody swamp.
We need all the land we can get.

639
00:48:46,609 --> 00:48:49,444
- But I don't like her.
- Don't like her?!

640
00:48:50,238 --> 00:48:51,688
What's wrong with her?!

641
00:48:51,788 --> 00:48:56,076
She's beautiful. She's rich.
She's got huge...

642
00:48:56,786 --> 00:48:58,203
tracts o' land!

643
00:48:59,288 --> 00:49:04,167
I know, but I want the...
the girl that I marry to have...

644
00:49:05,127 --> 00:49:08,588
...a certain,... special... something!

645
00:49:09,382 --> 00:49:11,633
Cut that out! Cut that out!

646
00:49:12,969 --> 00:49:17,472
Look, you're marrying Princess Lucky,
so you'd better get used to the idea!

647
00:49:18,808 --> 00:49:19,958
Guards!

648
00:49:20,309 --> 00:49:23,554
Make sure the Prince doesn't leave
this room until I come and get him.

649
00:49:23,654 --> 00:49:26,640
Not to leave the room,
even if you come and get him.

650
00:49:26,740 --> 00:49:28,775
No, no. Until I come and get him.

651
00:49:29,110 --> 00:49:32,320
Until you come and get him,
we're not to enter the room.

652
00:49:32,446 --> 00:49:37,284
No, no. No. You stay in the room
and make sure he doesn't leave.

653
00:49:37,577 --> 00:49:40,070
- And you'll come and get him.
- Right.

654
00:49:40,170 --> 00:49:43,832
We don't need to do anything apart
from just stop him entering the room.

655
00:49:44,125 --> 00:49:47,052
- No, no. Leaving the room.
- Leaving the room, yes.

656
00:49:47,200 --> 00:49:49,577
- All right?
- Right. Oh, if.. if.. if, uhh..

657
00:49:49,680 --> 00:49:51,580
if... if... w...
ehh... i... if... if we...

658
00:49:51,590 --> 00:49:52,590
Yes? What is it?

659
00:49:52,600 --> 00:49:54,022
Oh, i... if... i... oh...

660
00:49:54,100 --> 00:49:56,001
Look, it's quite simple.

661
00:49:56,019 --> 00:50:00,223
You just stay here and make
sure he doesn't leave the room.

662
00:50:01,392 --> 00:50:03,518
- All right?
- Oh, I remember.

663
00:50:03,686 --> 00:50:06,021
Uhh, can he leave the room with us?

664
00:50:06,480 --> 00:50:10,267
N... no, no. No. You just keep
him in here and make sure...

665
00:50:10,367 --> 00:50:12,644
Oh, yes. We'll keep him in here, obviously,

666
00:50:12,744 --> 00:50:14,563
but if he had to leave
and we were with him...

667
00:50:14,587 --> 00:50:16,405
No, no, no, no.
Just keep him in here...

668
00:50:16,410 --> 00:50:19,120
- Until you or anyone else...
- No, not anyone else. Just me.

669
00:50:19,125 --> 00:50:20,459
- Just you.
- Get back.

670
00:50:20,460 --> 00:50:21,460
Get back.

671
00:50:21,537 --> 00:50:22,537
- Right?
- Right.

672
00:50:22,671 --> 00:50:24,615
We'll stay here until you get back.

673
00:50:24,715 --> 00:50:27,542
- And, uh, make sure he doesn't leave.
- What?

674
00:50:28,878 --> 00:50:31,921
- Make sure he doesn't leave.
- The Prince?

675
00:50:32,048 --> 00:50:35,334
- Yes, make sure he doesn't leave.
- Oh, yes, of course.

676
00:50:35,434 --> 00:50:37,085
I thought you meant him.

677
00:50:37,185 --> 00:50:40,847
You know, it seemed a bit daft me
havin' to guard him when he's a guard.

678
00:50:41,265 --> 00:50:44,059
- Is that clear?
- Oh, quite clear. No problems.

679
00:50:44,226 --> 00:50:45,376
Right.

680
00:50:47,521 --> 00:50:50,106
- Where are you going?
- We're coming with you.

681
00:50:50,232 --> 00:50:54,361
No, no. I want you to stay here
and make sure he doesn't leave.

682
00:50:54,862 --> 00:50:56,071
Oh, I see. Right.

683
00:50:56,906 --> 00:50:57,906
But, Father...

684
00:50:57,910 --> 00:51:00,450
Shut your noise, you!
And get that suit on!

685
00:51:08,292 --> 00:51:10,251
And no singing!

686
00:51:10,628 --> 00:51:12,587
Oh, go and get a glass of water.

687
00:52:01,303 --> 00:52:03,880
- Well taken, Concorde!
- Thank you, sir! Most kind.

688
00:52:03,980 --> 00:52:05,473
And again!

689
00:52:05,808 --> 00:52:08,885
Over we go! Good, steady!

690
00:52:08,985 --> 00:52:11,187
Now, the big one!

691
00:52:12,022 --> 00:52:14,265
Uuh! Come on, Concorde!

692
00:52:15,192 --> 00:52:17,318
Message for you, sir.

693
00:52:19,864 --> 00:52:21,740
Concorde! Concorde! Speak to me!

694
00:52:31,417 --> 00:52:33,076
"To whoever finds this note.

695
00:52:33,176 --> 00:52:37,255
"I have been imprisoned by my father,

696
00:52:37,673 --> 00:52:40,250
"who wishes me to marry against my will.

697
00:52:40,350 --> 00:52:42,886
"Please, please, please come and rescue me.

698
00:52:43,387 --> 00:52:46,840
"I am in the tall tower of Swamp Castle."

699
00:52:46,940 --> 00:52:50,226
At last! A call! A cry of distress!

700
00:52:50,352 --> 00:52:53,513
This could be the sign
that leads us to the Holy Grail!

701
00:52:53,613 --> 00:52:58,193
Brave, brave Concorde,
you shall not have died in vain!

702
00:52:58,527 --> 00:53:00,236
Uh, I'm... I'm not quite dead, sir.

703
00:53:02,364 --> 00:53:04,941
Well, you shall not have
been mortally wounded in vain!

704
00:53:05,041 --> 00:53:07,368
I think I could pull through, sir.

705
00:53:08,370 --> 00:53:09,370
Oh, I see.

706
00:53:09,380 --> 00:53:11,639
Actually, I think I'm all
right to come with you, sir...

707
00:53:11,640 --> 00:53:13,375
No, no, sweet Concorde! Stay here!

708
00:53:13,400 --> 00:53:16,153
I will send help as soon as
I have accomplished a daring and

709
00:53:16,160 --> 00:53:18,905
heroic rescue in my own particular...

710
00:53:22,092 --> 00:53:23,885
- Idiom, sir?
- Idiom!

711
00:53:24,053 --> 00:53:27,430
- No, I feel fine, actually, sir.
- Farewell, sweet Concorde!

712
00:53:28,432 --> 00:53:31,601
I'll, um... I'll just stay
here, then. Shall I, sir?

713
00:53:33,646 --> 00:53:34,796
Yeah.

714
00:54:13,936 --> 00:54:15,270
- 'Morning!
- 'Morning.

715
00:54:17,500 --> 00:54:18,500
Oooh.

716
00:54:57,000 --> 00:54:59,000
Ha ha! Hiyya!

717
00:55:00,149 --> 00:55:01,299
Hey!

718
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:05,000
Hiyya!, Ha!

719
00:55:52,534 --> 00:55:54,869
Now, you're not allowed
to enter the room... aaugh!

720
00:55:56,914 --> 00:55:59,908
O fair one, behold your humble
servant, Sir Lancelot of Camelot.

721
00:56:00,008 --> 00:56:02,663
I have come to take...
Oh, I'm terribly sorry.

722
00:56:02,687 --> 00:56:03,920
You got my note!

723
00:56:04,254 --> 00:56:08,132
- Uh, well, I... I got, uh, a note.
- You've come to rescue me?

724
00:56:08,550 --> 00:56:11,344
-  Uh, well, no. You see, I...
- I knew someone would.

725
00:56:11,637 --> 00:56:16,265
I knew that somewhere out there,
...there must be... someone..

726
00:56:17,059 --> 00:56:19,268
Stop that! Stop that! Stop it! Stop it!

727
00:56:20,813 --> 00:56:21,813
Who are you?

728
00:56:21,909 --> 00:56:23,515
- I'm your son!
- No, not you.

729
00:56:23,615 --> 00:56:26,810
- Uh, I am Sir Lancelot, sir.
- He's come to rescue me, Father.

730
00:56:26,910 --> 00:56:29,714
- Well, let's not jump to conclusions.
- Did you kill all those guards?

731
00:56:29,800 --> 00:56:33,000
Uh... Oh, yes. Sorry.

732
00:56:33,124 --> 00:56:34,334
They cost fifty pounds each!

733
00:56:34,358 --> 00:56:36,758
Well, I'm awfully sorry.
Um, I really can explain everything.

734
00:56:36,760 --> 00:56:40,139
Don't be afraid of him, Sir Lancelot.
I've got a rope all ready.

735
00:56:40,499 --> 00:56:42,875
You killed eight wedding guests and all!

736
00:56:43,043 --> 00:56:45,570
Well, uh, you see, the thing is,
I thought your son was a lady.

737
00:56:45,580 --> 00:56:46,580
I can understand that.

738
00:56:46,888 --> 00:56:49,207
- Hurry, Sir Lancelot! Hurry!
- Shut up!

739
00:56:49,307 --> 00:56:51,182
You only killed the
bride's father, that's all!

740
00:56:51,206 --> 00:56:52,711
Well, I really
didn't mean to...

741
00:56:52,811 --> 00:56:55,547
Didn't mean to?! You put your
sword right through his head!

742
00:56:55,647 --> 00:56:58,633
- Oh, dear. Is he all right?
- You even kicked the bride in the chest!

743
00:56:58,733 --> 00:57:01,219
- This is going to cost me a fortune!
- Well, I can explain.

744
00:57:01,319 --> 00:57:02,982
I was in the forest,
um, riding north from

745
00:57:03,006 --> 00:57:04,669
Camelot, when I got
this note, you see...

746
00:57:04,800 --> 00:57:07,419
- Camelot? Are you from, uh, Camelot?
- Hurry, Sir Lancelot!

747
00:57:07,943 --> 00:57:10,020
Uh, I am a Knight of King Arthur, sir.

748
00:57:10,120 --> 00:57:13,114
Very nice castle, Camelot.
Uh, very good pig country.

749
00:57:13,866 --> 00:57:16,901
- Is it?
- Hurry! I'm ready!

750
00:57:17,001 --> 00:57:18,803
Would you, uh, like to
come and have a drink?

751
00:57:18,827 --> 00:57:21,001
Well, that... that's,
uh, awfully nice of you...

752
00:57:21,081 --> 00:57:24,242
- I am ready!
- ...um, I mean to be so understanding.

753
00:57:24,342 --> 00:57:26,079
...I'm afraid when
I'm in this idiom, I

754
00:57:26,103 --> 00:57:28,254
sometimes get a bit,
uh, sort of carried away.

755
00:57:34,928 --> 00:57:36,028
Now, this is the main hall.

756
00:57:36,050 --> 00:57:39,050
We're going to have all this knocked
through and made into one big, uh...

757
00:57:39,100 --> 00:57:42,195
- There he is!
- Oh, bloody hell.

758
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:49,000
- Ha ha ha! Hey!
- Hold it! Stop it! Hold it! Hold it!

759
00:57:49,100 --> 00:57:52,100
- Hold it! Hold it! Hold it! Please!
- Ha ha!

760
00:57:52,400 --> 00:57:55,400
Sorry. Sorry. You see what I
mean? I just get carried away.

761
00:57:55,415 --> 00:57:58,318
I'm really most awfully sorry.
Sorry! Sorry, everyone.

762
00:57:58,418 --> 00:57:59,827
He's killed the best man!

763
00:58:01,371 --> 00:58:05,867
Hold it! Hold it! Please! Hold it!
This is Sir Lancelot

764
00:58:05,967 --> 00:58:10,963
from the Court of Camelot, a
very brave and influential knight,

765
00:58:11,715 --> 00:58:14,584
- and my special guest here today.
- Hello.

766
00:58:14,684 --> 00:58:16,302
He killed my auntie!

767
00:58:17,054 --> 00:58:21,682
Please! Please! This is
supposed to be a happy occasion!

768
00:58:21,809 --> 00:58:25,728
Let's not bicker and argue
about who killed who.

769
00:58:26,522 --> 00:58:31,025
We are here today to witness the union
of two young people

770
00:58:31,151 --> 00:58:33,486
in the joyful bond of the holy wedlock.

771
00:58:35,072 --> 00:58:38,866
Unfortunately, one of them,
my son Herbert,

772
00:58:39,660 --> 00:58:41,702
has just fallen to his death.

773
00:58:42,538 --> 00:58:46,040
But I don't want to think I've lost a son,
so much as

774
00:58:46,542 --> 00:58:48,209
gained a daughter.

775
00:58:48,919 --> 00:58:52,163
For, since the tragic
death of her father...

776
00:58:52,263 --> 00:58:54,382
He's not quite dead!

777
00:58:55,717 --> 00:58:58,761
Since the near fatal
wounding of her father...

778
00:58:58,887 --> 00:59:00,638
He's getting better!

779
00:59:02,558 --> 00:59:05,893
For, since her own father

780
00:59:06,019 --> 00:59:09,355
who, when he seemed about to recover,

781
00:59:09,773 --> 00:59:13,234
suddenly felt the icy hand of death
upon him.

782
00:59:14,194 --> 00:59:15,361
 Oh, he's died!

783
00:59:15,863 --> 00:59:19,482
And I want his only
daughter to look upon me

784
00:59:19,582 --> 00:59:24,078
as her old dad, in a very
real and legally binding sense.

785
00:59:25,914 --> 00:59:30,585
And I feel sure that the merger...
er, the union between the Princess

786
00:59:31,295 --> 00:59:35,047
and the brave, but dangerous,
Sir Lancelot of Camelot...

787
00:59:35,465 --> 00:59:38,293
- What?
- Look! The dead Prince!

788
00:59:38,617 --> 00:59:41,017
GUESTS: Oooh! The dead Prince!

789
00:59:41,263 --> 00:59:44,765
- He's not quite dead!
- No, I feel much better.

790
00:59:44,892 --> 00:59:47,768
You fell out of the tall tower, you creep!

791
00:59:48,061 --> 00:59:51,814
- No, I was saved at the last minute.
- How?!

792
00:59:52,107 --> 00:59:53,774
Well, I'll tell you.

793
00:59:55,110 --> 00:59:58,110
Not like that! Not like that! No! Stop it!

796
01:00:08,500 --> 01:00:11,512
No, it's not right for my idiom.
I must escape more...

797
01:00:13,629 --> 01:00:16,797
- Dramatically, sir?
- Dramatically.

Excuse me. Could, uh... could
somebody give me a push, please?

801
01:00:47,537 --> 01:00:49,205
Old crone!

802
01:00:50,832 --> 01:00:54,335
Is there anywhere in this town
where we could buy a shrubbery?

803
01:00:55,170 --> 01:00:58,170
- Who sent you?
- The Knights Who Say 'Ni'.

804
01:00:58,200 --> 01:01:01,700
Aggh! No! Never! We
have no shrubberies here.

805
01:01:01,726 --> 01:01:05,846
If you do not tell us where we can buy
a shrubbery, my friend and I

806
01:01:06,223 --> 01:01:07,515
will say...

807
01:01:08,684 --> 01:01:11,519
We will say "Ni."

808
01:01:11,600 --> 01:01:13,600
Agh! Do your worst!

809
01:01:13,700 --> 01:01:17,463
Very well.
If you will not assist us voluntarily...

810
01:01:21,363 --> 01:01:22,530
- Ni!
- No!

811
01:01:23,323 --> 01:01:25,574
Never! No shrubberies!

812
01:01:25,909 --> 01:01:27,660
- Ni!
- Nu!

813
01:01:27,911 --> 01:01:29,011
- No, no, no, no, i...
- Nu!

814
01:01:29,050 --> 01:01:30,550
- No, it's not that. It's 'ni'. 
- Nu!

815
01:01:30,600 --> 01:01:32,471
No, no. 'Ni'. You're
not doing it properly. No.

816
01:01:32,500 --> 01:01:33,500
Ni!

817
01:01:33,600 --> 01:01:35,600
- Ni.
- That's it. That's it. You've got it.

818
01:01:35,700 --> 01:01:38,200
- Ni!
- Ni!

819
01:01:38,221 --> 01:01:41,340
Are you saying "Ni" to that old woman?

820
01:01:42,551 --> 01:01:43,626
Erm,... yes.

821
01:01:43,726 --> 01:01:46,026
Oh, what sad times
are these when passing

822
01:01:46,050 --> 01:01:48,639
ruffians can say 'ni'
at will to old ladies.

823
01:01:49,224 --> 01:01:52,393
There is a pestilence upon this land.
Nothing is sacred.

824
01:01:52,728 --> 01:01:54,723
Even those who arrange
and design shrubberies

825
01:01:54,747 --> 01:01:56,514
are under considerable
economic stress

826
01:01:56,614 --> 01:01:58,607
at this period in history.

827
01:01:58,734 --> 01:02:01,402
- Did you say "shrubberies"?
- Yes.

828
01:02:01,528 --> 01:02:04,522
Shrubberies are my trade. I am a shrubber.

829
01:02:04,622 --> 01:02:09,243
My name is 'Roger the Shrubber'. I
arrange, design, and sell shrubberies.

830
01:02:10,037 --> 01:02:12,246
- Ni!
- No! No, no, no! No!

831
01:02:13,248 --> 01:02:16,159
O Knights of Ni, we have
brought you your shrubbery.

832
01:02:16,259 --> 01:02:18,586
- May we go now?
- It is a good shrubbery.

833
01:02:18,795 --> 01:02:23,132
I like the laurels particularly.
But there is one small problem.

834
01:02:23,717 --> 01:02:24,867
What is that?

835
01:02:24,934 --> 01:02:29,263
We are now... no longer
the Knights Who Say 'Ni'.

836
01:02:29,287 --> 01:02:30,487
KNIGHTS OF NI: Ni! Shh!

837
01:02:30,500 --> 01:02:32,052
Shh! We are now the Knights Who Say

838
01:02:32,275 --> 01:02:35,770
'Ecky-ecky-ecky-ecky-
pikang-zoop-boing-goodem-zu-owly-zhiv'

839
01:02:36,688 --> 01:02:38,806
Therefore, we must give you a test.

840
01:02:38,906 --> 01:02:42,485
What is this test, O Knights of...
knights who till recently said 'Ni'?

841
01:02:43,236 --> 01:02:45,404
Firstly, you must find...

842
01:02:46,114 --> 01:02:47,823
another shrubbery!

843
01:02:48,992 --> 01:02:51,452
Not another shrubbery!

844
01:02:51,578 --> 01:02:53,443
Then, when you have
found the shrubbery, you

845
01:02:53,467 --> 01:02:55,289
must place it here
beside this shrubbery,

846
01:02:55,499 --> 01:02:57,316
only slightly higher,
so you get the two-level

847
01:02:57,340 --> 01:02:59,035
effect with a path
going down the middle.

848
01:02:59,135 --> 01:03:02,415
KNIGHTS OF NI: A path! A path! A path! Ni!
Shh! Knights of Ni! Ni! Ni! Shh! Shh!...

849
01:03:02,430 --> 01:03:05,257
Then, when you have
found the shrubbery,

850
01:03:05,300 --> 01:03:08,294
you must cut down the
mightiest tree in the forest...

851
01:03:08,804 --> 01:03:11,972
with... a herring!

852
01:03:11,996 --> 01:03:13,242
KNIGHTS OF NI: A herring!

853
01:03:13,266 --> 01:03:15,935
- We shall do no such thing!
- Oh, please!

854
01:03:16,311 --> 01:03:19,480
Cut down a tree with a herring?
It can't be done.

855
01:03:19,504 --> 01:03:21,167
KNIGHTS OF NI: Aaaaugh! Aaaugh!

856
01:03:21,191 --> 01:03:23,059
- Augh! Ohh! Don't say that word.
- What word?

857
01:03:23,159 --> 01:03:25,152
I cannot tell. Suffice to say,

858
01:03:25,278 --> 01:03:27,939
it's one of the words
the Knights of Ni cannot hear.

859
01:03:28,039 --> 01:03:30,942
How can we not say the word
if you don't tell us what it is?

860
01:03:31,042 --> 01:03:33,160
- You said it again!
- What, 'is'?

861
01:03:33,578 --> 01:03:37,782
No, not 'is'. You wouldn't get
vary far in life not saying 'is'.

862
01:03:37,882 --> 01:03:39,175
My liege, it's Sir Robin!

863
01:03:39,200 --> 01:03:43,578
<i>♪ He's jacking it in and packing it up ♪
♪ And sneaking away and buggering off ♪</i>

864
01:03:44,005 --> 01:03:46,094
<i>♪ And chickening
out and pissing a pot ♪</i>

865
01:03:46,118 --> 01:03:48,584
<i>♪ Yes, bravely he is
throwing in the sponge ♪</i>

866
01:03:48,684 --> 01:03:49,919
- Sir Robin! 
- My liege!

867
01:03:49,999 --> 01:03:51,967
- It's good to see you.
- Now he's said the word!

868
01:03:51,990 --> 01:03:54,260
Surely you've not given up
your quest for the Holy Grail?

869
01:03:54,300 --> 01:03:56,100
<i>♪ He is sneaking away and buggering up... ♪</i>

870
01:03:56,500 --> 01:03:57,500
Shut up!

871
01:03:57,600 --> 01:03:59,694
- No, no. No. Far from it.
- He said the word again!

872
01:03:59,946 --> 01:04:04,525
I was looking for it.
Uh, here... here in this forest.

873
01:04:04,693 --> 01:04:09,029
- No, it is far from this place.
- Aaaaugh! Stop saying the word!

874
01:04:09,156 --> 01:04:11,615
- The word we cannot hear!
- Stop it!

875
01:04:11,783 --> 01:04:13,776
- He said "it" again!
- That's it!

876
01:04:13,876 --> 01:04:16,871
Wait! I said it! I said it!
Ooh! I said it again!

877
01:04:17,074 --> 01:04:19,206
And there again,
that's three "its"!

878
01:04:25,380 --> 01:04:29,876
<i>And so Arthur and Bedevere and
Sir Robin set out on their search to find</i>

879
01:04:29,976 --> 01:04:33,888
<i>the enchanter of whom
the old man had spoken in Scene 24.</i>

880
01:04:35,390 --> 01:04:38,225
<i>Beyond the forest
they met Lancelot and Galahad,</i>

881
01:04:38,351 --> 01:04:40,728
<i>and there was much rejoicing.</i>

882
01:04:52,240 --> 01:04:54,484
<i>In the frozen land of Nador,</i>

883
01:04:54,584 --> 01:04:57,369
<i>they were forced to eat Robin's minstrels.</i>

884
01:04:58,038 --> 01:05:00,289
<i>And there was much rejoicing.</i>

885
01:05:01,917 --> 01:05:03,584
<i>A year passed.</i>

886
01:05:07,422 --> 01:05:09,882
<i>Winter changed into spring.</i>

887
01:05:10,425 --> 01:05:12,551
<i>Spring changed into summer.</i>

888
01:05:13,094 --> 01:05:15,505
<i>Summer changed back into winter,</i>

889
01:05:15,605 --> 01:05:20,142
<i>and winter gave spring and summer
a miss and went straight on into autumn.</i>

890
01:05:21,436 --> 01:05:22,686
<i>Until one day.</i>

891
01:05:44,918 --> 01:05:46,252
Knights,

892
01:05:47,462 --> 01:05:48,754
forward!

893
01:06:25,792 --> 01:06:28,369
What manner of man are you
that can summon up fire

894
01:06:28,469 --> 01:06:32,881
- without flint or tinder?
- I... am an enchanter.

895
01:06:35,927 --> 01:06:39,763
- By what name are you known?
- There are some who call me...

896
01:06:41,850 --> 01:06:44,518
- Tim.
- Greetings, Tim the enchanter!

897
01:06:44,644 --> 01:06:47,021
Greetings, King Arthur.

898
01:06:47,856 --> 01:06:49,523
- You know my name?
- I do.

899
01:06:57,532 --> 01:07:00,284
You seek the Holy Grail!

900
01:07:00,869 --> 01:07:03,946
That is our quest.
You know much that is hidden, O Tim.

901
01:07:04,046 --> 01:07:05,289
Quite.

902
01:07:13,548 --> 01:07:15,966
Yes, we're... we're
looking for the Holy Grail.

903
01:07:16,217 --> 01:07:17,649
Our quest is to
find the Holy Grail.

904
01:07:17,673 --> 01:07:20,137
KNIGHTS: Yeah. Yes. It is. It
is. Yeah. Yup. Yup. Hm. Mm.

905
01:07:23,350 --> 01:07:25,682
And so, we're...
we're... we're looking for it.

906
01:07:25,706 --> 01:07:27,806
KNIGHTS: Yes, we are. Yeah. We are. We are.

907
01:07:27,850 --> 01:07:29,350
- We have been for some time.
- Ages.

908
01:07:32,150 --> 01:07:36,570
Uh... uh, so, uh, anything that you
could do to, uh... to help... would be...

909
01:07:39,032 --> 01:07:40,182
very...

910
01:07:41,409 --> 01:07:44,244
- helpful.
- Look, can you tell us where...

911
01:07:48,083 --> 01:07:51,085
Fine. Um, I don't want to
waste any more of your time,

912
01:07:51,211 --> 01:07:55,211
but, uh, I don't suppose you could,
uh, tell us where we might find a,

913
01:07:55,230 --> 01:07:58,130
um... find a, uh... a, um... a, uh...

914
01:07:58,218 --> 01:07:59,843
A what...?

915
01:07:59,867 --> 01:08:01,967
A g... a... a g... a g... a... a g...

916
01:08:02,013 --> 01:08:03,589
A grail?!

917
01:08:03,689 --> 01:08:05,849
Yes, I think so.

918
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:08,200
KNIGHTS: Yes. Yes. Yup. That's it.

919
01:08:08,603 --> 01:08:09,770
Yes!

920
01:08:11,940 --> 01:08:14,775
- Oh. Thank you.
- Splendid!

921
01:08:18,613 --> 01:08:21,190
Look, um, you're a busy man, uh...

922
01:08:21,290 --> 01:08:25,953
Yes, I can help you find the Holy Grail.

923
01:08:26,413 --> 01:08:31,200
To the north, there lies a cave.
The Cave of Caerbannog.

924
01:08:31,300 --> 01:08:35,629
Wherein, carved in mystic runes,
upon the very living rock,

925
01:08:36,089 --> 01:08:39,425
the last words of Olfin Bedwere of Rheged

926
01:08:41,553 --> 01:08:46,473
make plain the last resting place
of the most Holy Grail.

927
01:08:47,392 --> 01:08:50,477
- Where could we find this cave, O Tim?
- Follow!

928
01:08:51,980 --> 01:08:56,066
But! Follow only if ye be men of valour,

929
01:08:56,484 --> 01:08:59,945
For the entrance to this cave
is guarded by a creature

930
01:09:00,447 --> 01:09:03,657
so foul, so cruel,

931
01:09:03,783 --> 01:09:06,994
that no man yet has
fought with it and lived!

932
01:09:08,580 --> 01:09:13,584
Bones of full fifty men
lie strewn about its lair.

933
01:09:14,127 --> 01:09:18,505
So, brave knights,
if you do doubt your courage

934
01:09:19,007 --> 01:09:21,842
or your strength, come no further,

935
01:09:22,177 --> 01:09:27,139
for death awaits you all
with nasty, big, pointy teeth.

936
01:09:29,601 --> 01:09:31,477
What an eccentric performance!

937
01:09:45,033 --> 01:09:46,442
They're nervous, sire.

938
01:09:46,542 --> 01:09:49,111
Then we'd best leave them here
and carry on, on foot.

939
01:09:49,211 --> 01:09:50,704
Dis-mount!

940
01:10:03,843 --> 01:10:07,846
Behold the Cave of Caerbannog!

941
01:10:10,266 --> 01:10:13,393
- Right, keep me covered.
- What with?

942
01:10:14,145 --> 01:10:16,522
- Just keep me covered.
- Too late!

943
01:10:17,857 --> 01:10:19,024
There he is!

944
01:10:22,111 --> 01:10:24,279
- Where?
- There!

945
01:10:25,323 --> 01:10:28,367
- What, behind the rabbit?
- It is the rabbit.

946
01:10:30,495 --> 01:10:32,947
- You silly sod!
- What?

947
01:10:33,047 --> 01:10:34,490
You got us all worked up!

948
01:10:34,590 --> 01:10:36,283
Well, that's no ordinary rabbit!

949
01:10:36,383 --> 01:10:41,338
That's the most foul, cruel and
bad-tempered rodent you ever set eyes on!

950
01:10:41,506 --> 01:10:45,133
You tit! I soiled my armor I was so scared!

951
01:10:45,260 --> 01:10:48,754
Look, that rabbit's got
a vicious streak a mile wide.

952
01:10:48,854 --> 01:10:50,840
- It's a killer!
- Get stuffed!

953
01:10:50,940 --> 01:10:53,259
- He'll do you up a treat, mate!
- Oh, yeah?

954
01:10:53,359 --> 01:10:55,886
- You manky Scots git!
- I'm warning you!

955
01:10:55,986 --> 01:10:59,648
- What's he do, nibble your bum?
- He's got huge, sharp...

956
01:11:00,692 --> 01:11:02,442
He can leap about...

957
01:11:02,902 --> 01:11:06,321
- Look at the bones!
- Go on, Bors, chop its head off!

958
01:11:06,447 --> 01:11:10,158
Right! Silly little bleeder.
One rabbit stew comin' right up!

959
01:11:12,537 --> 01:11:13,996
Look!

960
01:11:16,875 --> 01:11:20,035
- Jesus Christ!
- I warned you!

961
01:11:20,135 --> 01:11:22,204
- I done it again!
- I warned you,

962
01:11:22,304 --> 01:11:25,632
but did you listen to me?
Oh, no, you knew it all, didn't you?

963
01:11:25,800 --> 01:11:30,337
Oh, it's just a harmless little bunny,
isn't it? Well, it's always the same

964
01:11:30,437 --> 01:11:33,056
- I always tell them...
- Oh, shut up!

965
01:11:33,080 --> 01:11:34,493
Right!

966
01:11:34,517 --> 01:11:37,517
KNIGHTS: Charge!

967
01:11:53,036 --> 01:11:55,495
Run away! Run away!

968
01:11:55,519 --> 01:11:57,519
KNIGHTS: Run away! Run away!...

969
01:11:59,000 --> 01:12:02,000
Ha ha ha ha! Ha haw haw! Ha! Ha ha!

970
01:12:04,881 --> 01:12:06,916
- Right. How many did we lose?
- Gawain.

971
01:12:07,016 --> 01:12:09,043
- Ector.
- And Bors. That's five.

972
01:12:09,143 --> 01:12:11,094
- Three, sir.
- Three. Three.

973
01:12:11,471 --> 01:12:15,132
And we'd better not risk another
frontal assault. That rabbit's dynamite.

974
01:12:15,232 --> 01:12:17,843
Would it help to confuse it
if we run away more?

975
01:12:17,943 --> 01:12:21,305
- Oh, shut up and go and change your armor.
- Let us taunt it!

976
01:12:21,405 --> 01:12:24,183
It may become so cross
that it will make a mistake.

977
01:12:24,283 --> 01:12:25,433
Like what?

978
01:12:26,694 --> 01:12:27,844
Well...

979
01:12:30,907 --> 01:12:32,858
- Have we got bows?
- No.

980
01:12:32,958 --> 01:12:35,319
- We have the Holy Hand Grenade.
- Yes, of course!

981
01:12:35,419 --> 01:12:37,154
The Holy Hand Grenade of Antioch.

982
01:12:37,254 --> 01:12:40,074
'Tis one of the sacred relics
Brother Maynard carries with him!

983
01:12:40,174 --> 01:12:43,251
Brother Maynard!
Bring up the Holy Hand Grenade!

984
01:13:14,742 --> 01:13:16,034
How does it, um...

985
01:13:16,744 --> 01:13:17,903
How does it work?

986
01:13:18,003 --> 01:13:20,823
- I know not, my liege.
- Consult the Book of Armaments!

987
01:13:20,923 --> 01:13:24,710
Armaments, chapter two,
verses nine to twenty-one.

988
01:13:28,047 --> 01:13:31,967
"And Saint Attila raised the
hand grenade up on high, saying,

989
01:13:32,677 --> 01:13:36,797
" 'O Lord, bless this Thy hand
grenade that, with it, Thou mayest

990
01:13:36,897 --> 01:13:40,559
" blow Thine enemies
to tiny bits in Thy mercy.'

991
01:13:41,227 --> 01:13:44,304
"And the Lord did grin, and
the people did feast upon

992
01:13:44,404 --> 01:13:49,359
"the lambs and sloths and carp
and anchovies and orangutans

993
01:13:49,902 --> 01:13:53,402
"and breakfast cereals and
fruit bats and large chu..."

994
01:13:53,500 --> 01:13:54,500
Skip a bit, Brother.

995
01:13:55,700 --> 01:14:00,454
"And the Lord spake, saying,
'First shalt thou take out the Holy Pin.

996
01:14:01,289 --> 01:14:05,709
"Then, shalt thou count
to three. No more. No less.

997
01:14:06,627 --> 01:14:09,288
"Three shalt be the
number thou shalt count,

998
01:14:09,388 --> 01:14:12,382
"and the number of the
counting shall be three

999
01:14:12,967 --> 01:14:16,595
"Four shalt thou not count,
nor either count thou two,

1000
01:14:17,138 --> 01:14:19,806
"excepting that thou then proceed to three.

1001
01:14:21,142 --> 01:14:23,477
"Five is right out.

1002
01:14:24,645 --> 01:14:28,148
"Once the number three, being
the third number, be reached,

1003
01:14:28,566 --> 01:14:31,818
"then, lobbest thou thy Holy
Hand Grenade of Antioch

1004
01:14:31,944 --> 01:14:35,655
"towards thy foe, who,
being naughty in My sight,

1005
01:14:36,324 --> 01:14:37,991
"shall snuff it.'"

1006
01:14:38,659 --> 01:14:39,659
Amen.

1007
01:14:40,000 --> 01:14:41,000
KNIGHTS: Amen.

1008
01:14:41,170 --> 01:14:42,320
Right.

1009
01:14:42,914 --> 01:14:45,157
One!... Two!... Five!

1010
01:14:45,257 --> 01:14:47,125
- Three, sir!
- Three!

1011
01:15:33,089 --> 01:15:34,589
There! Look!

1012
01:15:35,508 --> 01:15:37,876
- What does it say?
- What language is that?

1013
01:15:37,976 --> 01:15:40,220
Brother Maynard! You are a scholar.

1014
01:15:40,388 --> 01:15:41,930
It is Aramaic!

1015
01:15:42,265 --> 01:15:45,142
Of course! Joseph of Arimathea!

1016
01:15:45,476 --> 01:15:47,561
- 'Course!
- What does it say?

1017
01:15:47,687 --> 01:15:51,014
It reads, "Here may be found

1018
01:15:51,114 --> 01:15:54,734
"the last words of Joseph of Arimathea.

1019
01:15:55,444 --> 01:15:58,697
"He who is valiant and pure of spirit

1020
01:15:59,490 --> 01:16:01,700
"may find the Holy Grail

1021
01:16:02,034 --> 01:16:06,329
"in the Castle of aaarrrrggh."

1022
01:16:08,249 --> 01:16:09,416
What?

1023
01:16:10,168 --> 01:16:14,004
"'...The Castle of aaarrrrggh'.

1024
01:16:14,672 --> 01:16:15,922
What is that?

1025
01:16:16,465 --> 01:16:18,667
He must have died while carving this.

1026
01:16:18,767 --> 01:16:21,595
- Oh, come on!
- Well, that's what it says.

1027
01:16:21,721 --> 01:16:25,307
Look, if he was dying, he wouldn't bother
to carve 'aarrggh'.

1028
01:16:25,516 --> 01:16:28,935
- He'd just say it!
- Well, that's what's carved in the rock!

1029
01:16:29,312 --> 01:16:31,305
- Perhaps he was dictating it.
- Oh, shut up.

1030
01:16:31,405 --> 01:16:33,682
- Well, does it say anything else?
- No!

1031
01:16:33,782 --> 01:16:37,027
Just 'aaarrrrggh'.

1032
01:16:38,988 --> 01:16:41,398
- Aaaauugggh. 
- Aarrrggh.

1033
01:16:41,498 --> 01:16:45,235
Do you suppose he meant the Camaaaaaargue?

1034
01:16:45,335 --> 01:16:47,321
- Where's that?
- In France, I think.

1035
01:16:47,421 --> 01:16:50,241
Isn't there a 'Saint
Aaauuves' in Cornwall?

1036
01:16:50,265 --> 01:16:52,209
No, that's 'Saint Ives'.

1037
01:16:52,501 --> 01:16:54,669
Oh, yes. Saint Iiiiives.

1038
01:16:54,693 --> 01:16:56,693
Oooohoohohooo!

1039
01:16:56,839 --> 01:16:59,374
No, no. 'Aaaauugggh', at the
back of the throat. Aaauugh.

1040
01:16:59,474 --> 01:17:02,594
N-- no. No, no, no, no.
'Oooooooh', in surprise and alarm.

1041
01:17:02,845 --> 01:17:05,597
- Oh, you mean sort of a 'aaaah'!
- Yes, that's right.

1042
01:17:05,621 --> 01:17:07,284
- aaaaaah! 
- Oooh!

1043
01:17:07,308 --> 01:17:08,458
My God!

1044
01:17:11,145 --> 01:17:13,813
It's the legendary Black
Beast of Aaarrrrggh!

1045
01:17:16,108 --> 01:17:19,069
That's it! That's it! Run away! Run away!

1046
01:17:19,093 --> 01:17:27,093
KNIGHTS: Run away!

1047
01:17:28,829 --> 01:17:30,330
KNIGHTS: Keep running.

1048
01:17:33,102 --> 01:17:35,102
KNIGHTS: Shh! Shh! Shh! Shh! Shh!

1049
01:17:35,127 --> 01:17:36,419
We've lost him.

1050
01:17:38,214 --> 01:17:40,966
<i>As the horrendous Black Beast
lunged forward,</i>

1051
01:17:41,676 --> 01:17:44,461
<i>escape for Arthur
and his knights seemed hopeless.</i>

1052
01:17:44,561 --> 01:17:48,556
<i>When, suddenly, the animator
suffered a fatal heart attack.</i>

1053
01:17:48,891 --> 01:17:51,476
<i>The cartoon peril was no more.</i>

1054
01:17:52,270 --> 01:17:55,146
<i>The quest for the Holy
Grail could continue.</i>

1055
01:18:07,285 --> 01:18:08,910
There it is!

1056
01:18:09,161 --> 01:18:13,373
- The Bridge of Death.
- Oh, great.

1057
01:18:13,541 --> 01:18:16,493
Look! There's the old man from Scene 24.

1058
01:18:16,593 --> 01:18:20,338
- What's he doing here?
- He is the keeper of the Bridge of Death.

1059
01:18:20,840 --> 01:18:23,166
He asks each traveler five questions.

1060
01:18:23,266 --> 01:18:25,210
- Three questions.
- Three questions.

1061
01:18:25,310 --> 01:18:28,880
- He who answers the five questions...
- Three questions.

1062
01:18:28,980 --> 01:18:33,427
...three questions, may cross in safety.
- What if you get a question wrong?

1063
01:18:33,527 --> 01:18:37,022
Then you are cast
into the Gorge of Eternal Peril.

1064
01:18:37,273 --> 01:18:40,442
- Oh, I won't go.
- Who's going to answer the questions?

1065
01:18:40,443 --> 01:18:41,443
- Sir Robin!
- Yes?

1066
01:18:41,450 --> 01:18:43,450
Brave Sir Robin, you go.

1067
01:18:44,155 --> 01:18:46,156
Hey! I've got a great idea.

1068
01:18:46,782 --> 01:18:48,317
Why doesn't Lancelot go?

1069
01:18:48,417 --> 01:18:51,153
Yes, let me go, my liege.
I will take him single-handed.

1070
01:18:51,253 --> 01:18:54,914
- I shall make a feint to the northeast...
- No, no. No. Hang on! Hang on! Hang on!

1071
01:18:55,124 --> 01:18:57,743
- Just answer the five questions...
- Three questions.

1072
01:18:57,843 --> 01:19:01,838
Three questions as best you
can, and we shall watch... and pray.

1073
01:19:02,048 --> 01:19:03,882
I understand, my liege.

1074
01:19:04,133 --> 01:19:07,761
Good luck, brave Sir Lancelot.
God be with you.

1075
01:19:12,224 --> 01:19:13,374
Stop!

1076
01:19:14,852 --> 01:19:19,481
Who would cross the Bridge of Death
must answer me these questions three,

1077
01:19:19,648 --> 01:19:21,858
ere the other side he see.

1078
01:19:22,068 --> 01:19:25,070
Ask me the questions, bridgekeeper.
I'm not afraid.

1079
01:19:25,321 --> 01:19:29,240
- What... is your name?
- My name is 'Sir Lancelot of Camelot'.

1080
01:19:29,992 --> 01:19:31,743
What... is your quest?

1081
01:19:31,994 --> 01:19:34,037
To seek the Holy Grail.

1082
01:19:34,538 --> 01:19:36,664
What... is your favorite color?

1083
01:19:37,124 --> 01:19:39,376
- Blue.
- Right. Off you go.

1084
01:19:40,836 --> 01:19:42,754
Oh, thank you. Thank you very much.

1085
01:19:47,218 --> 01:19:48,426
That's easy!

1086
01:19:51,472 --> 01:19:52,622
Stop!

1087
01:19:53,265 --> 01:19:57,936
Who approacheth the Bridge of Death,
must answer me these questions three,

1088
01:19:58,312 --> 01:20:00,522
ere the other side he see.

1089
01:20:01,357 --> 01:20:04,101
Ask me the questions, bridgekeeper.
I'm not afraid.

1090
01:20:04,201 --> 01:20:07,821
- What... is your name?
- 'Sir Robin of Camelot'.

1091
01:20:08,280 --> 01:20:11,408
- What... is your quest?
- To seek the Holy Grail.

1092
01:20:11,742 --> 01:20:13,868
What... is the capital of Assyria?

1093
01:20:16,705 --> 01:20:19,705
 I don't know that! Auuuuuuuugh!

1094
01:20:26,757 --> 01:20:27,907
Stop!

1095
01:20:28,759 --> 01:20:32,303
- What... is your name?
- 'Sir Galahad of Camelot'.

1096
01:20:32,513 --> 01:20:35,932
- What... is your quest?
- I seek the Grail.

1097
01:20:36,851 --> 01:20:39,936
- What... is your favorite color?
- Blue.

1098
01:20:40,771 --> 01:20:43,771
No, yel... auuuuuuuugh!

1099
01:20:47,655 --> 01:20:49,155
Hee hee heh.

1100
01:20:49,280 --> 01:20:50,430
Stop!

1101
01:20:50,531 --> 01:20:54,617
- What... is your name?
- It is 'Arthur', King of the Britons.

1102
01:20:55,035 --> 01:20:58,705
- What... is your quest?
- To seek the Holy Grail.

1103
01:20:59,540 --> 01:21:02,876
What... is the air-speed
velocity of an unladen swallow?

1104
01:21:03,669 --> 01:21:06,546
What do you mean?
An African or European swallow?

1105
01:21:07,548 --> 01:21:10,548
Huh? I... I don't know that. Auuuuuuuugh!

1106
01:21:15,347 --> 01:21:17,724
How do you know so much about swallows?

1107
01:21:17,850 --> 01:21:20,518
Well, you have to know these
things when you're a king, you know.

1108
01:22:00,692 --> 01:22:02,570
Lancelot!

1109
01:22:03,486 --> 01:22:04,899
Lancelot!

1110
01:22:06,380 --> 01:22:07,723
Lancelot!

1111
01:22:08,026 --> 01:22:09,176
Lancelot!

1112
01:22:10,933 --> 01:22:13,349
- Lancelot!
- Lancelot!

1113
01:22:18,000 --> 01:22:21,000
- Lancelot!
- Lancelot!

1114
01:22:24,000 --> 01:22:26,000
Lancelot!

1115
01:24:08,729 --> 01:24:13,066
The Castle "Aaargh".
Our quest is at an end.

1116
01:24:31,752 --> 01:24:33,336
God be praised.

1117
01:24:36,924 --> 01:24:38,333
Almighty God,

1118
01:24:38,433 --> 01:24:42,933
we thank Thee that Thou hast
vouchsafed to us the most holy...

1119
01:24:44,431 --> 01:24:46,557
Jesus Christ!

1120
01:24:47,768 --> 01:24:50,011
Allo, dappy English k-niggets

1121
01:24:50,111 --> 01:24:53,014
and Monsieur Arthur King,
who has the brain of a duck, you know.

1122
01:24:53,114 --> 01:24:56,142
So, we French fellows
outwit you a second time!

1123
01:24:56,242 --> 01:24:59,237
How dare you profane this place
with your presence?

1124
01:24:59,780 --> 01:25:03,700
I command you, in the name
of the Knights of Camelot,

1125
01:25:03,951 --> 01:25:06,911
to open the doors of this sacred castle,

1126
01:25:07,121 --> 01:25:10,581
to which God himself has guided us.

1127
01:25:10,791 --> 01:25:15,795
How you English say, 'I one more time,
mac, unclog my nose in your direction',

1128
01:25:16,088 --> 01:25:17,539
sons of a window-dresser!

1129
01:25:17,639 --> 01:25:20,208
So, you think you could
out-clever us French folk

1130
01:25:20,308 --> 01:25:23,878
with your silly knees-bent,
running about, advancing behavior.

1131
01:25:23,978 --> 01:25:26,764
I wave my private parts at your aunties.

1132
01:25:27,057 --> 01:25:31,636
You cheesy lot of second-hand,
electric donkey-bottom biters!

1133
01:25:31,736 --> 01:25:33,813
In the name of the Lord,

1134
01:25:33,939 --> 01:25:37,650
we demand entrance to this sacred castle!

1135
01:25:37,776 --> 01:25:40,562
No chance, English bed-wetting types.

1136
01:25:40,662 --> 01:25:44,899
I burst my pimples at you, and call your
door-opening request a silly thing!

1137
01:25:44,999 --> 01:25:48,403
You tiny-brained wipers
of other people's bottoms.

1138
01:25:48,503 --> 01:25:52,165
If you do not open this door,
we shall take this castle by force!

1139
01:25:54,001 --> 01:25:56,502
In the name of God and the glory of our...

1140
01:25:58,172 --> 01:26:00,673
Agh. Right! That settles it!

1141
01:26:01,508 --> 01:26:04,586
Yes, depart a lot at this time
and cut the approaching any more,

1142
01:26:04,686 --> 01:26:07,043
or we fire arrows at the
tops of your heads and

1143
01:26:07,067 --> 01:26:09,424
make castanets out of
your testicles already!

1144
01:26:09,524 --> 01:26:11,092
Walk away. Just ignore them.

1145
01:26:11,192 --> 01:26:15,146
And now remain gone,
illegitimate-faced bugger-folk!

1146
01:26:15,272 --> 01:26:19,934
And, if you think you got a nasty
taunting this time, you ain't heard

1147
01:26:20,034 --> 01:26:23,529
nothing yet, dappy English k-nnniggets!
Thpppt!

1148
01:26:45,385 --> 01:26:48,513
- We shall attack at once!
- Yes, my liege!

1149
01:26:48,680 --> 01:26:50,556
Stand by for attack!

1150
01:27:50,200 --> 01:27:51,617
French persons!

1151
01:27:52,536 --> 01:27:56,289
Today the blood of many a valiant knight
shall be avenged.

1152
01:27:56,874 --> 01:28:00,201
In the name of God,
we shall not stop our fight

1153
01:28:00,301 --> 01:28:05,089
till each one of you lies dead,
and the Holy Grail

1154
01:28:05,215 --> 01:28:08,801
returns to those whom God has chosen.

1155
01:28:10,262 --> 01:28:11,262
Charge!

1156
01:28:11,300 --> 01:28:19,300
ARMY OF KNIGHTS: Hooray!!!

1157
01:28:38,916 --> 01:28:42,916
- Yes, they're the ones, I'm sure.
- Come on. Anybody armed must go, too.

1158
01:28:42,990 --> 01:28:44,990
- All right. Come on. Back.
- Get that one.

1159
01:28:45,000 --> 01:28:46,000
- Back. Right away.
- Yes.

1160
01:28:46,100 --> 01:28:48,900
- Just... pull it off. Come on. Come along.
- Put this man in the van.

1161
01:28:53,513 --> 01:28:56,349
- Put him in the van.
- Get a blanket over that one.

1162
01:28:56,642 --> 01:28:59,185
Come on. Back. Riiight back. Come on!

1163
01:28:59,209 --> 01:29:00,209
Run along! Run along!

1164
01:29:00,250 --> 01:29:02,472
Pull that off. My, that's
an offensive weapon, that is.

1165
01:29:02,500 --> 01:29:04,500
Come on. Back with 'em.
Back. Right. Come along.

1166
01:29:06,985 --> 01:29:09,278
All right, sonny. That's enough.
Just pack that in.

1167
01:29:09,302 --> 01:29:10,302
Christ!
